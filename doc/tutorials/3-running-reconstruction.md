=====================================
- our `mermaid` diagram
  - JANA calls only what it needs
  - Show other `mermaid` diagrams, if needed
- JANA2 objects
  - Collections
  - `EDM4*` data model: our `datatypes` (ref. Thomas's PODIO talk)
  - Factories
  - Algorithms and EICrecon independence (ref. Sylvester's talk)
  - Configurations
  - Plugins
- `recon.rb` and our config files
  - CLI-level config (from our config files) 
  - Expected common-level refactoring to `toml`
  - `DRICH.cc` level config
  - Algorithm level default configs
- Benchmarks
  - Checking the output
