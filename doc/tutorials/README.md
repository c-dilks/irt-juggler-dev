dRICH Tutorial Series
=====================

Welcome to the dRICH Simulation Tutorials landing page! This page will link
to all of our tutorials, and is hosted here on Github to allow for updates
as needed. Before going through the dRICH tutorials, there are a few
prerequisite tutorials on ePIC software in general:

Prerequisite Tutorials
----------------------
These are tutorials given to the general ePIC Collaboration. Before following
any dRICH-specific tutorials, it is recommended to at least watch the
**REQUIRED** tutorials. The _optional_ prerequisites are not necessary, but are
helpful to have done in advance of the corresponding dRICH-specific tutorial
(e.g., watch the EICrecon tutorial before dRICH-specific reconstruction
tutorial).

1. Setup of eic-shell and Github (**REQUIRED**): <https://indico.bnl.gov/event/16826/>
2. DD4hep geometry basics (**REQUIRED**): <https://indico.bnl.gov/event/16828/>
3. Simulation with DD4hep (_optional_): <https://indico.bnl.gov/event/16830/>
4. Reconstruction with EICrecon (_optional_): <https://indico.bnl.gov/event/16833/>

dRICH Tutorials
---------------
These tutorials are organized in weekly sessions, first focusing on running the
code with examples, then reading through the corresponding code and providing a
tour of the implementation details.

1. [Setup and Running Simulations](1-setup-and-running-simulations.md)
2. [dRICH ePIC Geometry Code](2-geometry-code.md)
3. [Running Reconstruction and Benchmarks](3-running-reconstruction.md)
4. [Reconstruction Code Part I](4-reconstruction-code-part-1.md)
5. [Reconstruction Code Part II](5-reconstruction-code-part-2.md)
6. [Geometry Parameter Scanning](6-parameter-scanning.md) (optional, focused tutorial)
